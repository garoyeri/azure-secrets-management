This action helps you manage secrets in your Azure environment: creating,
rotating, and monitoring.

## Using Azure Secrets Management GitHub Action

To use the action, you first need to create a configuration file for the secrets
you want to manage. Here's an example:

```jsonc
// config.jsonc
{
  "defaults": {
    "resourceGroup": "resourceGroup1", // default resource group for Azure resources
    "keyVaultResourceGroup": "resourceGroup1", // default resource group for the Key Vault
    "keyVault": "vault1", // default Key Vault to use
    "keyVaultSecretPrefix": "", // prefix to use, be mindful of naming restrictions
    "expirationDays": 90, // when secrets expire
    "expirationOverlapDays": 30 // when to start rotating secrets before expiration
  },
  "resources": {
    // keys are configuration identifiers that happen to map to names of the secrets
    "storage1": {
      // different rotation strategies are supported, each will have its own documentation
      // and required properties
      "type": "azure/storage-account",
      "name": "storageaccountname"
    },
    "databaseServer1": {
      "type": "azure/postgresql-flexible-server",
      "name": "serverName1"
    },
    "databaseApplication1": {
      "type": "azure/postgresql-flexible-server/user",
      "name": "app1",
      "database": {
        "serverName": "databaseServer1",
        "roles": ["ROLE1", "ROLE2"]
      }
    },
    // certificates can be requested and rotated too, these are useful if you need
    // to use internally signed certificates or have a manual process for certificates
    // otherwise you should use some other service that supports ACME protocol
    "appCertificate1": {
      "type": "azure/keyvault/ssl-certificate",
      "name": "app.company.com",
      "expirationDays": 365,
      "expirationOverlapDays": 60,
      "certificate": {
        "subject": "C=US, ST=TX, L=Houston, O=Company, OU=Department Name, CN=app.company.com",
        "dnsNames": ["app.company.com", "*.app.company.com"],
        "keyStrength": 2048,
        "trustChainPath": "certificates/company.pem",
        "issuedCertificatePath": "certificates/app.company.com.pem"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Supported Rotation Strategies

These are rotation strategies that are implemented.

- [Manually updated secrets](docs/manually-rotating-secrets.md): Manually
  rotating secrets that are generated by some external source that can't be
  automated easily (yet).
- [Manually updated certificates](docs/manually-rotating-ssl-certificate.md):
  Manually rotating certificates that are requested and fulfilled by some
  external source. These would be stored as secrets in GitHub and injected
  during a run.
- [Key Vault Certificates issued by an external party](docs/keyvault-ssl-certificate.md):
  Using the Key Vault API to request certificates, fulfill them externally, then
  manually merge them to rotate the certificate.

## Planned Rotation Strategies

These are rotation strategies that are on the roadmap, but are not yet
implemented.

- [Postgres Flexible Server admin credentials](docs/rotating-postgres-admin-credentials.md):
  Randomly generating new superadmin credentials for a Azure PostgreSQL server.
  (TBD)

## Setting up your development environment

After you've cloned the repository to your local machine or codespace, you'll
need to perform some initial setup steps before you can develop your action.

> [!NOTE]
>
> You'll need to have a reasonably modern version of
> [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) handy (20.x or later should work!). If you are
> using a version manager like [`nodenv`](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv) or
> [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), this template has a `.node-version`
> file at the root of the repository that will be used to automatically switch
> to the correct version when you `cd` into the repository. Additionally, this
> `.node-version` file is used by GitHub Actions in any `actions/setup-node`
> actions.

1. :hammer_and_wrench: Install the dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. :building_construction: Package the TypeScript for distribution

   ```bash
   npm run bundle
   ```

1. :white_check_mark: Run the tests

   ```bash
   $ npm test

   PASS  ./index.test.js
     ✓ throws invalid number (3ms)
     ✓ wait 500 ms (504ms)
     ✓ test runs (95ms)

   ...
   ```

## Usage

After testing, you can create version tag(s) that developers can use to
reference different stable versions of your action. For more information, see
[Versioning](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
in the GitHub Actions toolkit.

To include the action in a workflow in another repository, you can use the
`uses` syntax with the `@` symbol to reference a specific branch, tag, or commit
hash.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Checkout
    id: checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v4

  - name: Test Local Action
    id: test-action
    uses: garoyeri/azure-secrets-management@main # Commit with the `main` branch (could be a tag name)
    with:
      milliseconds: 1000

  - name: Print Output
    id: output
    run: echo "${{ steps.test-action.outputs.time }}"
```

## Publishing a new release

This project includes a helper script designed to streamline the process of
tagging and pushing new releases for GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. Our script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent release tag by looking at the local data available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the latest release tag
   and provides a regular expression to validate the format of the new tag.
1. **Tagging the new release:** Once a valid new tag is entered, the script tags
   the new release.
1. **Pushing the new tag to the remote:** Finally, the script pushes the new tag
   to the remote repository. From here, you will need to create a new release in
   GitHub and users can easily reference the new tag in their workflows.
